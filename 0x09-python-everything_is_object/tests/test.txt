print("I")
print("Love")
print("Python")
julien@ubuntu:/tmp/so$

#advanced
guillaume@ubuntu:/python3$ cat string.py 
a = "SCHL"
b = "SCHL"
del a
del b
c = "SCHL"
guillaume@ubuntu:/python3$ 
Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 
with default options/configuration (For answers with 
numbers use integers, donâ€™t spell out the word):

How many string objects are created by the execution of 
the first line of the script? (106-line1.txt)
How many string objects are created by the execution of 
the second line of the script (106-line2.txt)
After the execution of line 3, is the string object pointed by a deleted? 
Answer with Yes or No (106-line3.txt)
After the execution of line 4, is the string object pointed by b deleted? 
Answer with Yes or No (106-line4.txt)
How many string objects are created by the execution of 
the last line of the script (106-line5.txt)
